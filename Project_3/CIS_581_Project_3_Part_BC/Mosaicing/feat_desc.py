  File clarification:
    Extracting Feature Descriptor for each feature point. You should use the subsampled image around each point feature, 
    just extract axis-aligned 8x8 patches. Note that it’s extremely important to sample these patches from the larger 40x40 
    window to have a nice big blurred descriptor. 
    - Input img: H × W matrix representing the gray scale input image.
    - Input x: N × 1 vector representing the column coordinates of corners.
    - Input y: N × 1 vector representing the row coordinates of corners.
    - Outpuy descs: 64 × N matrix, with column i being the 64 dimensional descriptor (8 × 8 grid linearized) computed at location (xi , yi) in img.
