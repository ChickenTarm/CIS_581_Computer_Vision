  File clarification:
    Matching feature descriptors between two images. You can use k-d tree to find the k nearest neighbour. 
    Remember to filter the correspondences using the ratio of the best and second-best match SSD. You can set the threshold to 0.6.
    - Input descs1: 64 × N1 matrix representing the corner descriptors of first image.
    - Input descs2: 64 × N2 matrix representing the corner descriptors of second image.
    - Outpuy match: N1 × 1 vector where match i points to the index of the descriptor in descs2 that matches with the
                    feature i in descriptor descs1. If no match is found, you should put match i = −1.
