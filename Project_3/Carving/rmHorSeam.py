    you should begin backtracking in order to identify pixels for removal, and 
    remove those pixels from the input image. 
    
    - INPUT I: n × m × 3 matrix representing the input image.
    - INPUT My: n × m matrix representing the cumulative minimum energy map along horizontal direction.
    - INPUT Tby: n × m matrix representing the backtrack table along horizontal direction.
    - OUTPUT Iy: (n − 1) × m × 3 matrix representing the image with the row removed.
    - OUTPUT E: the cost of seam removal.
