    remove those pixels from the input image. 
    
    - INPUT I: n × m × 3 matrix representing the input image.
    - INPUT Mx: n × m matrix representing the cumulative minimum energy map along vertical direction.
    - INPUT Tbx: n × m matrix representing the backtrack table along vertical direction.
    - OUTPUT Ix: n × (m - 1) × 3 matrix representing the image with the row removed.
    - OUTPUT E: the cost of seam removal.
